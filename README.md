Udacity Nano-Degree program on Autonomous Vehicles

## Lane Line Detection

1. Finding lane lines on the road project is located [here](https://github.com/schandrachary/AutonomousVehicles/tree/finding_lane_lines/Fundamentals_of_computer_vision/CarND-LaneLines-P1-master).
2. The first part of the challenge, which includes detecting the lane lines and extrapolating the segmented lines to a solid line and running lane detection pipeline on a video stream can be found in [FindingLaneLines.py](https://github.com/schandrachary/AutonomousVehicles/blob/finding_lane_lines/Fundamentals_of_computer_vision/CarND-LaneLines-P1-master/FindingLaneLines.py)
3. The second part of the challenge, which include detecting the lane lines for curved lane scenraio can be found in [curvedLaneFinding.py](https://github.com/schandrachary/AutonomousVehicles/blob/finding_lane_lines/Fundamentals_of_computer_vision/CarND-LaneLines-P1-master/curvedLaneFinding.py)

## Advanced Lane Line Finding

1. Source code for Advanced Lane Line finding algorithm is found [here](https://github.com/schandrachary/AutonomousVehicles/tree/advanced_computer_vision/Advanced%20Computer%20Vision/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines-master/source)
2. Output images from the algorithm are saved [here](https://github.com/schandrachary/AutonomousVehicles/tree/advanced_computer_vision/Advanced%20Computer%20Vision/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines-master/output_images)
3. Follow the [writeup](https://github.com/schandrachary/AutonomousVehicles/blob/advanced_computer_vision/Advanced%20Computer%20Vision/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines-master/writeup_template.md) here to get a brief explanation of the algorithm and how to run the code

## Traffic Sign Classifier

1. This project was developed on Ipython notebook and it located [here](https://github.com/schandrachary/AutonomousVehicles/tree/traffic_sign_classifier/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project)
2. The test images downloaded from web to test on the model is located [here](https://github.com/schandrachary/AutonomousVehicles/tree/traffic_sign_classifier/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project/test_images)
3. The writeup for this project is located [here](https://github.com/schandrachary/AutonomousVehicles/blob/traffic_sign_classifier/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project/writeup_traffic_sign_recognition.md)
4. Note that the pickle file with augmented data set is not uploaded on the repository due to file size constraints. If you want to download this project and run, please contact me.
