Udacity Nano-Degree program on Autonomous Vehicles

### Lane Line Detection
1. Finding lane lines on the road project is located [here](https://github.com/schandrachary/AutonomousVehicles/tree/finding_lane_lines/Fundamentals_of_computer_vision/CarND-LaneLines-P1-master).
2. The first part of the challenge, which includes detecting the lane lines and extrapolating the segmented lines to a solid line and running lane detection pipeline on a video stream can be found in [FindingLaneLines.py](https://github.com/schandrachary/AutonomousVehicles/blob/finding_lane_lines/Fundamentals_of_computer_vision/CarND-LaneLines-P1-master/FindingLaneLines.py)
3. The second part of the challenge, which include detecting the lane lines for curved lane scenraio can be found in [curvedLaneFinding.py](https://github.com/schandrachary/AutonomousVehicles/blob/finding_lane_lines/Fundamentals_of_computer_vision/CarND-LaneLines-P1-master/curvedLaneFinding.py)

## Advanced Lane Line Finding

1. Source code for Advanced Lane Line finding algorithm is found [here](https://github.com/schandrachary/AutonomousVehicles/tree/advanced_computer_vision/Advanced%20Computer%20Vision/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines-master/source)
2. Output images from the algorithm are saved [here](https://github.com/schandrachary/AutonomousVehicles/tree/advanced_computer_vision/Advanced%20Computer%20Vision/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines-master/output_images)
3. Follow the [writeup](https://github.com/schandrachary/AutonomousVehicles/blob/advanced_computer_vision/Advanced%20Computer%20Vision/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines-master/writeup_template.md) here to get a brief explanation of the algorithm and how to run the code
