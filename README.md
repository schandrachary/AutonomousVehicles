# AutonomousVehicles
Udacity Nano-Degree program on Autonomous Vehicles

## Particle Filter
1. The source code for this project can be located [here](https://github.com/schandrachary/AutonomousVehicles/tree/particle_filter/CarND-Kidnapped-Vehicle-Project-master/src)
2. On the parent directory, clean.sh cleans the build
3. build.sh, builds the project
4. On successful build, the project can be run using run.sh
5. Turn on the simulator and navigate to "Kidnapped Vehicle" simulation and hit the start button
6. You should see blue and green lines almost align with each-other marking coherence to groundtruth
7. The project is marked successful if the error is within range and the car completes three loops within 100 seconds
